<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Preface for example, simply delete lines 32-33 above or add a "#"" before them to comment out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this:
-->

<!--

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, delete the extra .Rmd file and then knit again.
-->

<!-- You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the _bookdown.yml file for PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there. Do not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd,  00(two-hyphens)abstract.Rmd and 00(two-hyphens)executive summary.Rmdsince they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.

<!-- The {.unnumbered} option here means that the introduction will be "Chapter 0." You can also use {-} for no numbers on chapters, which is the standard for each section.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

We built a deep learning model to help individuals generate interesting music ideas. The model is a GAN-based generator. The data used to train the generator are 130,000 midi files across many different genres of music.
        
## Problem Statement {.unnumbered}

In 1950s, experimental music composers wrote music using randomized statistical modelling. In 1990s, David Bowie built the Verbasizer, which implemented a random re-ordering of group of words and sentences to produce potentially significant lyrical combinations. Nowadays, there is an entire industry built around AI generated music including Flow Machines, IBM Watson Beat and Googleâ€™s NSynth. 

Our purpose is to build an effective platform to help artists in their creative process and assist them in music composition. Note that artists do not have to be professionally designated. Any individual interested in creating music should find the platform useful and empowering.  The first concrete step we need to take to achieve that goal is to build a music generation model that is able to generate music that is similar to what a human would compose in the style of music the model is trained on.


## Research Purpose {.unnumbered}

The purpose of this project is to develop a deep learning based music generator (instrumental music) which has a good understanding of the language of music and is able to generate human-like outputs, ultimately helping musicians and non-musicians alike to develop and refine musical ideas, and facilitate them in the music composition process. We divided the project into two parts, Generation and Validation. 

By doing this iteratively, the weights and parameters of the model will hopefully converge to a point at which the music generated is satisfactory to the user, who can use the output of the model, or save the weights for future use.  In a sense, we are democratizing deep learning to non-technical users wishing to generate new music ideas in a novel way. Moreover, we expect the algorithmic process to able to explore more music combinations than any individual, and thus provide a more holistic and creative approach to music creation.

## Variables and Scope {.unnumbered}

Our data consists of 130,000 midi files curated by a Reddit user, with a size of 3.65GB uncompressed. The collection has a great amount of variety representing all major genres in classical, jazz, metal, pop, etc. These midi files can be parsed by python packages such as midi and music21 into numpy arrays that preserves the note duration information, and our model will be trained on them.

## Writing Tips {.unnumbered}

* Develop an outline of what you are going to write for each section before you start writing
* Good writing follows a general format: introduction, body, and conclusion. This rule applies to the entire project, to each section, and to each paragraph
* Each paragraph presents only one idea and follows the **MEAL** rule
    + **M**ain: start the paragraph with the _Main_ idea
    + **E**xplain the concepts and define the terms
    + **A**nalyze the idea
    + **L**ink: conclude the paragraph and _Link_ it to the next paragraph 
* Make sure to define any concepts or terms that reader might be unfamiliar with right before or after they are used

**More info**

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there. 

**Spacing and Markdown**

Be careful with your spacing in _Markdown_ documents.  While white-space largely is ignored, it does at times give _Markdown_ signals as to how to proceed.  As a habit, try to keep everything left aligned whenever possible, especially as you type a new paragraph.  In other words, there is no need to indent basic text in the Rmd document (in fact, it might cause your text to do funny things if you do).



## R Markdown Basics {#rmd-basics .unnumbered}

### Lists {.unnumbered}

It's easy to create a list.  It can be unordered like

* Item 1
* Item 2

or it can be ordered like

1. Item 1
4. Item 2

Notice that I intentionally mislabeled Item 2 as number 4.  _Markdown_ automatically figures this out!  You can put any numbers in the list and it will create the list.  Check it out below.

To create a sub-list, just indent the values a bit (at least four spaces or a tab).  (Here's one case where indentation is key!)

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
    - Item 3a
    - Item 3b

### Line breaks {.unnumbered}

Make sure to add white space between lines if you'd like to start a new paragraph.  Look at what happens below in the outputted document if you don't:

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence.  Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.
This should be a new paragraph.

*Now for the correct way:* 

Here is the first sentence.  Here is another sentence.  Here is the last sentence to end the paragraph.

This should be a new paragraph.
