 - Results of model performance and validation

```{r summary}
kable(summary(ToothGrowth), align = "r", caption = "Summary of ToothGrowth data",
      format = "latex", longtable = TRUE)
```

Table \@ref(tab:summary) above contains summary statistics of the _Tooth Growth_ data.

While the code is not displayed to create the graph below (`echo=FALSE`), it is displayed in the Appendix by referencing the `boxplot` chunk name..

```{r boxplot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  message=FALSE, fig.cap="Avg. length by  supplement and dose", fig.width=6}
data(ToothGrowth)
colnames(ToothGrowth) <- c("length", "supplement", "dose")
ToothGrowth$dose <- as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose)

groupedTooth <- aggregate(ToothGrowth, by=ToothGrowth[,2:3], FUN=mean)[,1:3]

library(ggplot2)
 ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = supplement, y = length)) + 
                     geom_boxplot(aes(fill=supplement)) + 
                     facet_wrap(~dose) + 
                     guides(colour = guide_legend("Color = Supplement")) + 
                     labs(x="Orange Juice or Vitamin C, grouped by dose", 
                          y="Odontoblast Growth (microns)")  +
                     theme_bw()
```

Figure \@ref(fig:boxplot) was created with the `ggplot2` package. We can visually compare the average tooth growth by `supplement` and `dose`.

## Modeling results  {.unnumbered}

First, use a `t.test()` to test _if_ dosage leads to growth of incisor length. From the results below, it appears every test rejects the null hypothesis.

```{r t-test}
test1 <- t.test(length ~ dose, ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5,1)) 
test2 <- t.test(length ~ dose, ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(0.5,2))
test3 <- t.test(length ~ dose, ToothGrowth, dose %in% c(1,2)) 

testAgg <- data.frame(Name = c("Test 0.5-1", "Test 0.5-2", "Test 1-2"),
                  Method = c(test1$method, test2$method, test3$method), 
               Pvalue = c(test1$p.value, test2$p.value, test3$p.value), 
          Tstat = c(test1$statistic, test2$statistic, test3$statistic))

kable(testAgg, digit = 7, align = "r", caption = "t-test results", 
      format = "latex", longtable = TRUE)
```

Table \@ref(tab:t-test)

## Results of model performance and validation  {.unnumbered}

Next, subset the `ToothGrowth` data into seperate data sets defined by supplement dose of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg. This allow us to controlling for dose increases of _economic_ significance.

Subset tooth data into a separate `data.frame` for each dosage level. Then Execute the `t.test()` function for the dosage of 0.5 mg and display the results. 

```{r}
dose05 <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose == 0.5, ] 
 dose1 <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose == 1, ]
 dose2 <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose == 2, ]

 test4 <- t.test(length ~ supplement, data = dose05)
 test5 <- t.test(length ~ supplement, data = dose1)
 test6 <- t.test(length ~ supplement, data = dose2)
```

Place the results of the analysis directly into your content with ***inline code*** functions:

With a very low p-value of `r round(test4$p.value, 4)` and a corresponding t-statistic of `r round(test4$statistic, 4)`, it appears that at low doses, _Orange Juice_ is the preferable delivery mechanism to _Vitamin C_ for Ascorbic Acid delivery.

The p-value and t-statistic above have been directly extracted from the model object and printed inline. using the 'r foo' syntax with quotes(') replaced by back-ticks (`).
