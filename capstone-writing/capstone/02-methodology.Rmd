# Methodology {#methodology .unnumbered}

The methodology section may include the following subsections:

 - Data 
 - Descriptive analyses
 - Modeling Framework

## Data {#methodology-data .unnumbered}

**General description of the data and source(s). This includes limitations and delimitations; units of analysis; time window for aggregation and modeling (if applicable); and validation and development samples.**

Let's revisit the work of E.W. Cramptonâ€™s November 22, 1946 paper titled _The Growth of the Odontoblasts of the Incisor Tooth as a Criterion of the Vitamin C Intake of the Guinea Pig_. It is one of the data sets available within in the R statistical programming environment.

From the description file (`?ToothGrowth`): 

>The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice (OJ) or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C, coded VC).

Variables:

 - *len*:	_numeric_.	Tooth length
 -	*supp*:	_factor_.	Supplement type (VC or OJ).
 - *dose*:	_numeric_.	Dose in milligrams/day


```{r data}
data(ToothGrowth)
```

## Descriptive analyses {#methodology-descriptive .unnumbered} 

**Identification of the methodologies that would provide a view into the data. These may include highlighting the relationships that are important for the research, validating assumptions with respect to important metrics, and providing evidence that substantiates the way data is analyzed.**



```{r datatable, echo=TRUE}
growth_short <- rbind(ToothGrowth[1:7,], ToothGrowth[26:34,], ToothGrowth[53:60,])
kable(growth_short, align = "r", format = "latex", 
      longtable = TRUE, caption = "Tooth Growth")
```

Table: \@ref(tab:datatable): Head, center, and tail of _Tooth Growth_ data.

## Modeling Framework {#methodology-modeling .unnumbered}

**Justification of model(s) selected. Identification of dependent and independent variables, per model as well as variable transformations. Feature extraction (if applicable). Discussion of model(s) functional form. Assumptions of model(s) and ways of insuring that assumptions are observed or tested. Assessing model(s) performance and validation.**

Transform `dose` into a `factor`. Only three dosage levels are present.

```{r transform}
data(ToothGrowth)
colnames(ToothGrowth) <- c("length", "supplement", "dose")
ToothGrowth$dose <- as.factor(ToothGrowth$dose)
```
 
We are most interested in discovering which treatment leads to the optimal tooth growth.
In this vein, we use `aggregate` function to transform our data and compute the average tooth `length` by both `supplement` type  and `dose` size.


```{r group, warning=FALSE}
groupedTooth <- aggregate(ToothGrowth, by=ToothGrowth[,2:3], FUN=mean)[,1:3]

kable(groupedTooth, align = "r", caption = "Average tooth length",
      format = "latex", longtable = TRUE)
```

\TeX\ is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed \TeX\ when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics.  One nice feature of _R Markdown_ is its ability to read \LaTeX\ code directly.

Get around math mode's automatic italicizing in LaTeX by using the argument `$\mathrm{formula here}$`, with your formula inside the curly brackets.  (Notice the use of the backticks here which enclose text that acts as code.)

So, $\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$ is written `$\mathrm{Fe_2^{2+}Cr_2O_4}$`.

The \noindent command below does what you'd expect:  it forces the current line/paragraph to not indent. See below and examples of commonly used symbols:

\noindent Exponent or Superscript written as `$x^2$` becomes $x^2$

\noindent Subscript written as `$x_1$` becomes $x_1$

\noindent Infinity written as `$\infty$` becomes $\infty$

\noindent alpha written as `$\alpha$` becomes $\alpha$

\noindent beta written as `$\beta$` becomes $\beta$

\noindent delta written as `$\delta$` becomes $\delta$

\noindent epsilon written as `$\epsilon$` becomes $\epsilon$

\noindent sigma written `$\sum_{i=1}^n f(x)$` becomes $\sum_{i=1}^n f(x)$
