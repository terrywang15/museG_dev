We propose the application of deep learning to generate new music ideas to aid individuals in their music creation process. This approach in using deep learning differs from current approaches that emphasize automation which removes human input in the music generation process. The purpose is to have an interaction between human and AI. As such, it should be seen as an augmentation. The generated sample results can be perceived as musical. However, we include a few ideas on the future improvement of the model training process.

Our primary model is a GAN with two components: a generator and a discriminator (also called critic). The generator takes a random input and outputs a midi sample (a file type for music). The discriminator takes a midi sample as the input and outputs a classification of "real" or "fake". For real samples, we used a midi data repository containing 130,000 midi files across many different genres of music. For this project, we specifically used Baroque music. We structured our data with two main components in mind: the pitch and the duration of the note. The pitch was one-hot encoded with 128 possible pitches. The duration of the note was broken out by start time and end time, which are positive float vectors. This structure seems to perform the best out of the many we tried.

In order to set up the model training for success, the tempo of the music had to be made constant and varying keys had to be tranposed to C major and A minor. Additionally, data had to be further pre-processed so the deep learning system can interpret and learn the structure in the data. To perform these steps, our work includes a modified version of the python package pretty_midi. We adapted pretty_midi's main engine to manipulate midi files with varying tempo and key changes, adapt midi files into data structures usable by python, and reverse-adapt our output back into a midi that can be used by music production software. Lastly, we provided an assortment of utility functions and model selections, which we made into a python package together with the pretty_midi.
