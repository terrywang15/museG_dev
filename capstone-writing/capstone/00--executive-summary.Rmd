We propose the application of Deep Learning models to help individuals generate interesting music ideas, with the goal of aiding musicians to use these computer-generated musical ideas to enhance their music writing process. The results show limited success in reaching our goal of meaningful musical output, and we include a few ideas for future improvement on the model.

Our main model is a Generative Adversarial Network with two components: the generative model, which takes a Gaussian noise input of length 128 and outputs a numpy array representing a 20-note midi sample; the discriminator, which takes an input of the numpy array representing a 20-note midi sample and outputs a float between 0 and 1, with 1 representing real and 0 fake. For real samples, we used a midi data repository totaling 130,000 midi files across many different genres of music, but for this project specifically we used mostly Baroque music. For generated samples, we use a deep neural network structure that terminates in separate branches for pitches, whose output is a length 128 softmax vector representing the probabilities of the pitches, and duration, whose output is a vector of 2 positive numbers representing the start and end time of the note, for each of the 20 notes generated. This structure seems to perform the best out of the many structures we tried.

Some other models we tried are based on time series prediction of music notes, including an RNN model which uses grouping of 3 notes as input to predict the next 3 notes.

Our work includes a modified version of the python package pretty_midi. We adapted its main engine to pre-process midi files with varying tempo and key changes and write midi files into numpy array, as well as putting the generated numpy array back into the midi format. In addition, we provided an assortment of utility functions and model selections, which we made into a python package together with the pretty_midi.
