We propose the application of Deep Learning models to help individuals generate interesting music ideas. The platform has a GAN-based generator. The data used to train the generator are 130,000 midi files across many different genres of music. The algorithmic process is expected to be able to explore more music combinations than any individual, and thus provide a more holistic and creative approach to music creation.

Our work includes a modified version of the python package pretty_midi, which serves as a midi pre-processing starter package for Deep Learning. Using Generative Adversarial models, we provide insights on predicting pitches and duration to ultimately generate music notes.
